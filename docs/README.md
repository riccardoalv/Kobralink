# FarolPrint documentation

FarolPrint makes an Anycubic Kobra printer in LAN mode (Kobra X, Kobra 4) look like a Moonraker printer. You add the
printer by its IP address and then use it from OrcaSlicer, the web dashboard or any Moonraker client, with Spoolman,
camera, AI failure detection, notifications and Home Assistant. It never changes the printer's firmware.

## In one minute

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riccardoalv/farolprint/main/infra/docker-compose.prod.yml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riccardoalv/farolprint/main/infra/.env.example -o .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Then open `http://<host>:7100`, create the first account and add the printer by its IP (LAN mode on).
